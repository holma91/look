# Foundations: Shopify 101

The 2 key players are:

- Merchants
  The people that use Shopify to sell stuff. E.g, a T-shirt store.
- Partners
  The people that offer services to merchants. E.g, a shopify app/extension.
  There are 2 types of **product partners**:
  - Foundational: Stuff like Stripe, Facebook and Google
  - Ecosystem: Stuff like Klaviyo
    When Shopify talks about partners, they are generally referring to ecosystem partners.

There is also "Growth Partnerships", which seems to be e.g agencies that work with many shopify merchants. The highest tier is Plus Agency Partners.

There are > 2 million merchants on Shopify.

### The Shopify Partner Program

For experimenting with the Shopify platform through unlimited "development stores".
TODO: join this program

"Shopify Plus Partners" are a network of "Service and Certified App Partners" that help merchants on Shopify Plus.

### The Shopify Affiliate Program

For people who teach their audience about Shopify. Not interesting.

## Shopify - the platform

2 types of of apps:

- Public apps
  Listed on the App Store

### Sales channels

Allow merchants to advertise and sell in places beyond the online store.

- Shop app and Shop Pay
- Social media

Partners can build sales channels apps!

## Terminology
