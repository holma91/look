Dropshipping is the best choice, because we don't want to deal with any storage and shipping.
Print-on-demand if customization is needed, but it's currently not.

## Dropshipping overview

**1. Supplier Partnership**: You partner with a supplier who holds inventory.
**2. Product Listing**: You list the supplier's products on your website.
**3. Order Placement**: Customer places an order on your site.
**4. Order Forwarding**: You forward the order to the supplier.
**5. Fulfillment**: Supplier packs and ships the product directly to the customer.
**6. Payment**: You pay the supplier their wholesale price; you keep the retail markup.

With that in mind, we need to find a supplier. It would be beneficial if we could place the order via API to this supplier.

### Notes from YT videos

This whole space is full of scammers lol.

My store is probably a "hybrid store"!

Facebook ads, tiktok ads or tiktok organic marketing for getting customers.

What types of suppliers are there?
"Forwarders" are a middle-hand between the manufacturer and me.

Suppliers:
