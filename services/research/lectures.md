## Stable Diffusion Deep Dive Notebook

### Lesson 10

Imagic paper

- take an image of a thing and change what it's doing

### Lesson 11

DiffEdit paper

- semantic image editing
  - very relevant to what I'm doing

### Lesson 12

**CLIP Interrogator**

- does not return the text that generates the photo
  The CLIP image encoder takes an input image and return a text embedding. Then inverse function does not exist (probably).

### Learning to do

- LORAs in depth.
- controlnet
- fine-tune something
