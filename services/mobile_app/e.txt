### INJECT

We have the url. Inject different scripts depending on: domain.

user goes to lululemon/1 -> scripts get inserted
user goes to lululemon/2 -> scripts get inserted

urls are now different.
if productData is different -> sendMessage with productData
                       else -> try again ~5 times
