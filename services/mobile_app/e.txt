### INJECT

ASSUMPTION: url changes when product changes
VIOLATIONS: boozt,

WHAT DO: let user handle it

We have the url. Inject different scripts depending on: domain.

user goes to lululemon/1 -> scripts get inserted
user goes to lululemon/2 -> scripts get inserted

urls are now different.
if productData is different -> sendMessage with productData
                       else -> try again ~5 times

### RECEIVE
Can receive 3 types of messages: productData, imageByClick, imageByScript

when receiving productData:
                          1. parse it depending on the url
when receiving imageByClick:
                          1. make sure that the productUrl is in the database
                          2. parse the imageSrc depending on the url
                          2. insert into database
                          3. update UI state to show the clicked image in the sheet
when receiving imageByScript:
                          1. make sure that the productUrl is in the database
                          2. log them

when to show no product?
when we are at an url, and haven't received a product


Can we somehow notify the webview when we've received a product at a url?
 
### Post-mortem
There's a case to be made for the following:
- sites differ to much in their loading product stuff, so it's not worth it to try 
a general solution that works for all of them.

Instead, do it similarly to how we do with the parsing. Have a base approach that works
for good sites, and then a domain specific approach for bad sites.
