# MVP

I see a road to a mvp!

Choose a few sites that work, e.g zalando.

1. User picks an image from history
2. send image -> embeddings are computed
3. send points -> masks are predicted

## Overlay mask on the image

### Canvas-based rendering

### Semi-Transparent View

### SVG Overlay

### Pre-Generated Mask Image on the server

Generate image mask on the server, send it back to the client.
