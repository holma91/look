- choose model UI

### TODO far away

- write "connectors" for every website. this shouldn't be hard, say 1000 US sites and 100 swedish sites.
- write basic adblocking software.
- make it so that when a user favorites something, it's checked daily if the size exists etc.
- put in shopping info somewhere in app, and autofill on sites
