It's too much work to make the parsing work for every website. Instead, let's focus on integrating sites that just works.

### Sites with issues

- hm.com
  Only provides image for one colour per product
- lululemon.com
  Missing price and need to do a crazy sync to get it to work
- softgoat.com
  Need to select images by hand
- boozt.com
  weird extra query param in url, image doesn't change when we change url
- careofcarl.se
  two schema.org objects with type == Product per item
- loropiana
  schema doesn't reload when changing colors

### Sites that just works

- zalando.com
- farfetch.com
- adaysmarch.com
  use schema as lock!
- gucci.com
