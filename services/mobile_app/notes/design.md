### Notes from reading Apple HIG

from: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color

- if performing operations that are similar to ones that exist natively, use the same colors
-

### conclusion

For system colors, just grab them from apple and put them in the theme. Name colors with stuff like iosGray and androidGray then conditionally render what we should show depending on the user. Or, conditionally render a template depending on the device? (This is probably better).
