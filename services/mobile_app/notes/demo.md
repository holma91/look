what needs to be finished for the demo?

- extraction for all chosen sites
- ui for uploading images, waiting for model to be created, and view created models
- ui for filtering likes/history

1. ui for model creation
   first thing we see:

when clicking create:

- all the text above the flatlist should be removed
- the images in the flatlist should move to the top of the screen

### Code Debt from Demoware

Create.screen.tsx. Not necessarily bad if we disregard when creationMode is true.
