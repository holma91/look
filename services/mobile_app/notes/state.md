what parts are client state?

- dark mode
- browsing history
- filter and all that stuff
- chosen model

what parts are server state?

- everything else?

what parts are unclear?

- training
-

### conclusion

continue using react-query heavily (for all server state).
start using jotai or zustand the next time we need a global store (choosing model)?
