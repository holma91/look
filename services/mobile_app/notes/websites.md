This is a page where we note all the oddities with websites.

**shop.lululemon.com**:
the schema.org updates slowly when going from one color to another. it's the whole reason for us doing the !arraysAreEqual check in Browser.screen.txs:handleMessage.

**boozt.com**:
the url doesn't even change when going from one color to another.
