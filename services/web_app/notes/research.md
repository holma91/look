### Objective

What do I wanna find out:

- how are clothes made?
  - how are the parts measured? how exact?

### Creating a shirt, from start to finish

1. Design and Development
   Before the actual manufacturing process. This involves:

- Sketching or CAD of the garment
- Selection of fabric (and other materials)

2. Sourcing of Materials
   When the design is finalized, the next step is to source the required garments. This includes:

- Fabric: The primary material used in making the garment.
- Trims: These can be anything from buttons and zippers to ribbons and lace.
- Other essentials stuff like thread, labels and packaging.

3. Fabric Preparation
   Before the fabric can be used to make garments, it often needs to be pre-treated. This can include:

- Washing: to remove any impurities and prepare it for dyeing.
- Dyeing: to give the fabric its desired color.
- Printing: in case the design requires any patterns or logos.

4. Cutting
   Once the fabric is ready, it is laid out in large layers and cut into the required shapes. These shapes, often referred to as patterns, form the different parts of the garment.

5. Sewing or Assembly
   The cut pieces are sewn together to form the garment.

6. Finishing
   After the garment is assembled, it goes through a finishing process which can include:

- Ironing or pressing
- Inspection
- Washing
- Labeling and tagging

### Cutting

The process of cutting the fabric. Steps could be:

1. Pattern making: A pattern for the garment is created. This pattern later serves as a template for cutting the fabric. A pattern can be made of paper.
2. Spreading: To produce multiple garments simultaneously, multiple layers of fabric are spread out on long tables.
3. Choose a cutting method and cut:

- Manual Cutting
  Using scissors or something similar, used for smaller production.
- Die Cutting
  Metal dies in the shape of pattern pieces are used to stamp out the pieces. It's good for consistent, repetitive cuts.
- Band Knife Cutting
  Accurate and used for bulk production.
- Laser or Plasma Cutting
  Modern methods can use laser beams or hot plasma to cut the fabric. Very precise.

4. Bundling: Once cut, the pieces are bundled together according to size and design.

### Sewing

The process of assembling the cut pieces together to form a finished garment. The sewing process varies depending on the garment's design, but can look something like:

1. Stitching
2. Sewing: Many different ways the sewing can be done, and it's classified by "seam type".
3. Assembly Line Production: Each worker or group of workers handles a specific part of the sewing process.
4. Pressing: After sewing, seams and stitched areas are often pressed to lie flat. This makes the garment look better and can make subsequent sewing steps easier.
5. Quality Control
6. Final Assembly: More complex garments can have multiple steps.
7. Trimming: Any excess threads or fabric are trimmed off to give a clean finish.

## Sizing

Sizing comes into play during the cutting stage, and specifically in the making of patterns. Each size will have it's own set of patterns. The patterns dictate the dimensions of each part of the garment, and are adjusted to fit the measurements specified for each size.

**pattern grading**:
the process of creating patterns for each size based on a base size pattern. You'll typically have a base size, and scale different parts of the pattern up and down depending on some specified rules.

### software for 3D visualization

Clo3D looks like the best alternative. Visualizes the garment on a 3D avatar.

## Thoughts

- Provide users with technology to measure their bodies.
  With this, sizes across brands can then be recommended.
  - V1: measure by yourself and put it in your profile
  - V2: scan your body with a camera and automatically get measurements
- Provide users with technology to visualize themselves in garments
  - V1: stable diffusion to visualize face on model
  - V2: NN to visualize face on model AND body shape
  - V3: V2 but in 3D

### Terminology

**ease**:
The difference between body measurements (like the ones you see on the sizing chart) and the actual garment measurements.
