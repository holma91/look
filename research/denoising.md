Denoising strength determines how much noise should be added at each step.

Lower Denoising Strength will make your generated images look similar to your input image, and therefore low values can be useful if you only want to make small modifications.

Higher Denoising Strength increases variation and reduces the influence of your input image on your output image, which makes high values useful for significant modifications.
