### Bottom Line

- Get segmentation to work in full

### TODO

- study the sam frontend code
- check out cog by replicate
  https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/flask_rest_api_tutorial.html
- probably use torchserve

- deploy locally a very basic server that runs sam

1. Create SAM server
2. make it run a default prediction on an endpoint
3. keep going from there
