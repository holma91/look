So I'm building a tool that will be for ecommerce sites to use. Most of these sites use Shopify. So, naturally I should learn how Shopify works.

###

I would like the following:

1. companies integrate with us
   2a. we get their products (images, price, etc)
   2b. they get to be on our site
   2c? they get to embed us into their shopify site

### how

To see how all this will work, we'll need to set up a T-shirt store so that we know what it looks like from the other side. Then to do this for non shopify sites aswell.
